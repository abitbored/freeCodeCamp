				<p>The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive.</p>
				<p>Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write
					programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system
					enables
					flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the
					convenience
					of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled
					language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language. </p>
				In this tutorial, you'll get a brief introduction to Go programming. Along the way, you will:
				#make the ul li elements
				<ul>
					<li>Install Go (if you haven't already).</li>
					<li>Write some simple "Hello, world" code.</li>
					<li>Use the go command to run your code.</li>
					<li>Use the Go package discovery tool to find packages you can use in your own code.</li>
					<li>Call functions of an external module.</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>Some programming experience. The code here is pretty simple, but it helps to know something
						about functions.</li>
					<li>A tool to edit your code. Any text editor you have will work fine. Most text editors have good
						support for Go. The most popular are VSCode (free), GoLand (paid), and Vim (free).</li>
					<li>A command terminal. Go works well using any terminal on Linux and Mac, and on PowerShell or cmd
						in
						Windows.</li>

			<article>
				<p>Get started with Hello, World.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Open a command prompt and cd to your home directory.</p>
						<p>On Linux or Mac:</p>
						<code>cd
						</code>
						<p>On Windows:</p>
						<code>cd %HOMEPATH%
						</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Create a hello directory for your first Go source code.</p>
						<code>mkdir hello
							cd hello
						</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Enable dependency tracking for your code. </p>
						<p>When your code imports packages contained in other modules, you manage those dependencies
							through your code's own module. That module is defined by a go.mod file that tracks the
							modules that provide those packages. That go.mod file stays with your code, including in
							your source code repository. </p>
						<p>To enable dependency tracking for your code by creating a go.mod file, run the <a
								href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-init"><span class="mono">go mod init</span>
								command</a>, giving it the name of the module your code will be in. The name is the
							module's module path.</p>
						<p>In actual development, the module path will typically be the repository location where your
							source code will be kept. For example, the module path might be github.com/mymodule. If you
							plan to publish your module for others to use, the module path must be a location from which
							Go tools can download your module. For more about naming a module with a module path, see
							<a href="https://go.dev/doc/modules/managing-dependencies#naming_module">Managing
								dependencies</a>.
						</p>
						<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, just use <span class="mono">example/hello</span>.</p>
						<code>$ go mod init example/hello
							go: creating new go.mod: module example/hello
						</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>In your text editor, create a file hello.go in which to write your code.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Paste the following code into your hello.go file and save the file.</p>
						<code>package main

						import "fmt"

						func main() {
						    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
						}
						</code>
						<p>This is your Go code. In this code, you: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Declare a main package (a package is a way to group functions, and it's made up of all
								the files in the same directory).</li>
							<li>Import the popular <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/fmt"><span class="mono">fmt</span>
									package</a>, which contains functions for formatting text, including
								printing to the console. This package is one of the <a
									href="https://pkg.go.dev/std">standard library</a> packages you got
								when you installed Go. </li>
							<li>Implement a <span class="mono">main</span> function to print a message to the console. A
								main function executes by
								default when you run the <span class="mono">main</span> package. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Run your code to see the greeting.</p>
						<code>$ go run .
							Hello, World!
						</code>
						<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_and_run_Go_program"><span class="mono">go
									run</span> command</a> is one of many go commands you'll use to get things done with
							Go. Use the
							following command to get a list of the others: </p>
						<code>$ go help
						</code>
					</li>

			<header>Call code in an external package</header>
			<article>
				<p>When you need your code to do something that might have been implemented by someone else, you can
					look for a package that has functions you can use in your code. </p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Make your printed message a little more interesting with a function from an external module.
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Visit pkg.go.dev and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/search?q=quote">search for a "quote"
									package</a>.</li>
							<li>Locate and click the <span class="mono">rsc.io/quote</span> package in search results
								(if you see <span class="mono">rsc.io/quote/v3</span>,
								ignore it for now). </li>
							<li>In the <span class="bold">Documentation</span> section, under <span
									class="bold">Index</span>, note the list of functions you can call from your code.
								You'll use the Go function. </li>
							<li>At the top of this page, note that package quote is included in the <span
									class="mono">rsc.io/quote</span> module.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>You can use the pkg.go.dev site to find published modules whose packages have functions you
							can use in your own code. Packages are published in modules -- like <span
								class="mono">rsc.io/quote</span> -- where
							others can use them. Modules are improved with new versions over time, and you can upgrade
							your code to use the improved versions. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>In your Go code, import the rsc.io/quote package and add a call to its Go function.</p>
						<p>After adding the highlighted lines, your code should include the following: </p>
						<pre>
							<code>package main

								import "fmt"

								import "rsc.io/quote"

								func main() {
									fmt.Println(quote.Go())
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Add new module requirements and sums.</p>
						<p>Go will add the <span class="mono">quote</span> module as a requirement, as well as a go.sum
							file for use in authenticating the module. For more, see <a
								href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#authenticating">Authenticating modules</a> in the Go
							Modules Reference.</p>
						<code>$ go mod tidy
							go: finding module for package rsc.io/quote
							go: found rsc.io/quote in rsc.io/quote v1.5.2
						</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Run your code to see the message generated by the function you're calling.</p>
						<code>$ go run .
							Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.
						</code>
						<p>Notice that your code calls the Go function, printing a clever message about communication.
						</p>
						<p>When you ran go mod tidy, it located and downloaded the <span
								class="mono">rsc.io/quote</span> module that contains the
							package you imported. By default, it downloaded the latest version -- v1.5.2. </p>
					</li>

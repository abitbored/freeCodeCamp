				We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were
				silent.<br>
				I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the
				Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says,
				<strong>'Now I am
					become Death, the destroyer of worlds.'</strong><br>
				I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.<br>
